## Technical Implementation Guides

### MDN Web Docs Tutorial
Mozilla Developer Network provides a comprehensive tutorial on building a breakout game with pure JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. This tutorial covers:
- Setting up the Canvas
- Implementing ball and paddle mechanics
- Creating brick layouts
- Handling collision detection
- Implementing scoring and game states

### Collision Detection Techniques

When implementing collision detection for your breakout game, consider these approaches:

1. **Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) Collision Detection**
   - Most suitable for rectangular objects like bricks and paddles
   - Checks if object boundaries overlap or intersect
   - Efficient for large numbers of objects

2. **Collision Side Detection**
   - Determines which side of a brick was hit
   - Helps calculate the appropriate ball bounce direction
   - Enhances gameplay realism

3. **Implementation Pattern**
   ```javascript
   // Example collision detection pattern
   function checkCollision(ball, object) {
     // Check if ball's boundaries intersect with object's boundaries
     return (ball.x + ball.radius > object.x &&
             ball.x - ball.radius < object.x + object.width &&
             ball.y + ball.radius > object.y &&
             ball.y - ball.radius < object.y + object.height);
   }
   ```

## Game Design Resources

### Brick Layout Patterns

While specific visual diagrams are limited in availability, consider these approaches for brick layouts:

1. **Classic Row-Based Layout**
   - 8 rows of bricks with different colors
   - Each color corresponds to different point values
   - Arranged in a grid pattern across the top of the screen

2. **Level Progression Layouts**
   - Increase complexity in brick arrangements as levels progress
   - Add indestructible bricks in strategic positions
   - Create patterns with gaps to increase difficulty

3. **Implementation Approach**
   ```javascript
   // Example brick initialization pattern
   function createBricks() {
     const bricks = [];
     for (let r = 0; r < rowCount; r++) {
       bricks[r] = [];
       for (let c = 0; c < columnCount; c++) {
         // Position each brick with appropriate spacing
         const brickX = c * (brickWidth + brickPadding) + brickOffsetLeft;
         const brickY = r * (brickHeight + brickPadding) + brickOffsetTop;
         
         // Assign color and point value based on row
         let color, points;
         if (r < 2) { // Top rows (red)
           color = "#FF0000";
           points = 7;
         } else if (r < 4) { // Orange rows
           color = "#FFA500";
           points = 5;
         } else if (r < 6) { // Green rows
           color = "#00FF00";
           points = 3;
         } else { // Bottom rows (yellow)
           color = "#FFFF00";
           points = 1;
         }
         
         bricks[r][c] = { x: brickX, y: brickY, status: 1, color: color, points: points };
       }
     }
     return bricks;
   }
   ```
