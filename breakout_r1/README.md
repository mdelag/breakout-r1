### About Breakout

Breakout was created in 1976 by Atari, developed by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow. It adapted Pong's mechanics for solo play and pioneered the "paddle & ball vs. blocks" game mechanic that became a foundational element in arcade and home video game history.

The game's core mechanics involve:
- A player-controlled paddle at the bottom of the screen
- A ball that bounces off the paddle, walls, and bricks
- Rows of bricks at the top of the screen that are destroyed when hit by the ball
- The goal is to clear all bricks without letting the ball fall below the paddle

## Installation Instructions for Rabbit R1

1. **Download the Game Files**
   - Download the game package (`breakout_r1.zip`) from the provided link
   - Extract the files to a temporary location on your computer

2. **Transfer to Rabbit R1**
   - Connect your Rabbit R1 device to your computer via USB
   - When prompted, select "File Transfer" mode on your R1
   - Copy the extracted game files to the "Games" folder on your R1
   - If the "Games" folder doesn't exist, create it first

3. **Launch the Game**
   - Disconnect your R1 from the computer
   - Navigate to the "Games" folder using the scroll wheel
   - Select the "Breakout" folder
   - Tap the "index.html" file to launch the game

4. **Alternative Installation**
   - If your R1 has internet connectivity, you can access the game directly by navigating to the hosted version at the provided URL
   - The game will automatically adapt to the R1's display and controls

## Controls

### Using the Scroll Wheel (Primary Control Method)

- **Scroll Down**: Move paddle right
- **Scroll Up**: Move paddle left
- **Scroll Speed**: Controls paddle movement speed (adaptive sensitivity)
- **Push Button**: Pause/Resume game (when available)

The game has been specifically optimized for the R1's scroll wheel with:
- Reduced sensitivity for more precise control
- Event throttling to prevent overwhelming the game
- Smooth movement with easing for natural control

### Alternative Controls

- **Touch**: Tap left or right side of screen to move paddle
- **Keyboard** (if available): Left/Right arrow keys to move paddle
- **Pause**: Tap center of screen or press P key

## Game Rules and Scoring

### Basic Rules

1. Move the paddle to bounce the ball and prevent it from falling off the bottom of the screen
2. Break all the bricks to complete a level
3. You start with 3 lives
4. Lose a life when the ball falls below the paddle
5. Game ends when all lives are lost or all levels are completed

### Scoring System

Different brick colors have varying point values:
- Yellow bricks: 1 point each
- Green bricks: 3 points each
- Orange bricks: 5 points each
- Red bricks (top level): 7 points each

Additional scoring mechanics:
- Points are earned by destroying bricks with the ball
- Breaking all bricks in a level awards bonus points
- Consecutive brick hits without touching the paddle increase point multipliers

## Special Considerations for Rabbit R1

### Hardware Considerations

- **Display**: The game is optimized for the R1's 2.88-inch LCD touchscreen (640x480px)
- **Performance**: Optimized for the MediaTek Helio G36 processor and 4GB RAM
- **Input**: Specially adapted for the R1's scroll wheel as the primary input method

### Optimizations for R1

1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Delta time implementation for consistent gameplay regardless of frame rate
   - Optimized collision detection to reduce CPU usage
   - Object pooling to reduce memory usage
   - Frame rate limiting with fallback options
   - Reduced visual effects for better performance

2. **Input Handling Optimizations**
   - Scroll wheel debouncing for smoother control
   - Adaptive sensitivity based on scroll speed
   - Smooth paddle movement with easing
   - Multiple input method fallbacks

3. **Display Optimizations**
   - UI elements sized appropriately for the 2.88-inch screen
   - High contrast visuals for better visibility on the small display
   - Simplified graphics for optimal performance

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Scroll Wheel Response Issues

- **Problem**: Paddle moves inconsistently or too fast/slow
- **Solution**: Adjust sensitivity in the game settings menu or restart the game

### Performance Issues

- **Problem**: Game runs slowly or stutters
- **Solution**: 
  - Close other applications running on your R1
  - Enable "Performance Mode" in the game settings
  - Reduce visual effects in settings if available

### Game Not Loading

- **Problem**: Game fails to start or shows a blank screen
- **Solution**:
  - Ensure your R1 has the latest system updates
  - Try restarting your R1 device
  - Reinstall the game files

### Controls Not Working

- **Problem**: Paddle doesn't respond to scroll wheel
- **Solution**:
  - Try alternative controls (touch or keyboard if available)
  - Restart the game
  - Check if scroll wheel works in other applications
